# toy-interpreters

An implementation of both tree walking and bytecode interpreters from the books by Thorsten Ball and Robert Nystrom.

All the code is very messy and has never been refactored / cleaned up. The purpose of these projects is to get a basic understanding of interpreters and language design before creating my own hobby language.

## Language

So I don't forget, a list of potential features I'd like to consider for my own toy language:

* Errors as values
* Error productions & Python-esque formatting
* Ternary
* Linux/Mac/Windows keywords, e.g. `fn linux function() {}`
* Statically typed
* Some concept of a standard library
* `defer` and `comptime` keywords from Zig
* Generics
* Async
* LSP/Formatter
* Destructuring
* Optional chaining
* Switch 
* Lazy evaluation
* Format strings
* List comprehension
* For-in loops
