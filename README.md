# toy-interpreters

An implementation of both tree walking and bytecode interpreters from the books by Thorsten Ball and Robert Nystrom.

All the code is very messy and has never been refactored / cleaned up. The purpose of these projects is to get a basic understanding of interpreters and language design before creating my own hobby language.
